            <h2> About Alpha Kappa Psi</h2>
            <p>The <span class="fun"> AKPsi chapter </span> at JHU focuses on professional development and brotherhood. Brothers of AKPsi are among the best students interested in business and are involved in the campus and the community. AKPsi organizes many business-related networking and speaker events during the academic year for Hopkins undergraduates.</p> 
            
            <p><b>Founded</b> - We were founded 2001.</p>
            <p><b>Countries</b> - We represent over 10 countries.</p>
            <p><b>Majors</b> - We represent over 20 different majors, ranging from International Studies to Biomedical Engineering and everything in between.</p>
            
            <p> Our fraternity pledge process involves four main sectors of business: finance, consulting, marketing, and entrepreneurship. During this process, pledges will be learning from experienced brothers on what skills does it take to get a job in one of these sectors. They learn through practicing and applying the knowledge they learn </p>
            
            <p> Once as a brother, you will reap <em>all</em> the rewards AKPsi has to give: a strong network, knowledgable amateurs, and opportunities to get involved. You also receive a dope pin. However, AKPsi is more than just business. It is about forming friendships that will last a lifetime. </p>
            
            <p> As our humble president Hayden Rosenthal once put it:</p>
            <blockquote class="fun">
                <p>"Brotherhood is the bedrock of our fraternity. Without it, we are just a group of snakes."</p>
            </blockquote>
