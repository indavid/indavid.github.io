                <p>I am an experience and brand designer, a photographer, and a writer. I am currently a sophomore at Cornell University studying UX design and Comparative Literature with a minor in business.</p>
                <p>Standing at the intersection of design and humanities, I am passionate about applying literary and cultural theories to build technology that maximizes the experience of “being human”.</p>
                <p>I am constantly searching for better ways to inspire others through design thinking and through interdisciplinary collaboration. I believe in the magic of creation--its universality, its inclusiveness, and its power to ignite passion. I look forward to creating human-centered social enterprise and developing a holistic perspective on designing for a change.</p>
                <p>Companies I have worked with includes: IDEO Colab, Adobe, Bloomberg Businessweek, Cornell Daily Sun, Getty Images, Huffington Post and etc.  For work inquiries or coffee chat, reach me at mh2235@cornell.edu.</p>
