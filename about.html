                I am currently a sophomore at Johns Hopkins University studying computer science.
                <br/><br/>
                I am passionate about creating software that empowers and inspires people. I believe that behind great software is a well told story that captivates peopleâ€™s hearts. I enjoy designing seamless user experiences that make people happy. I love being inspired by art, especially by minimalism. I am always looking to learn from those who are more experienced and to teach to those who are less experienced.
                <br/><br/>
                My current interests are in the blockchain, UI/UX design, web development, and game development. I love collaborating with strangers, so if you are interested in working together, please contact <a href="mailto:david94539@gmail.com">me</a>.
                <br/><br/>
                I also love photography, music, people, and jesus.
